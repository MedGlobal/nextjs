# nextjs-boilerplate [Typescript duhhh!]

This is my first nextjs boilerplate. The intention is to use nextjs in SSR and CSR.

## Dependencies

The idea is to have the following dependencies preinstalled and ready to use:

- Apollo Client
- [MUI](https://mui.com)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

The boilerplate will rely heavily on MUI. So don't use it if you are not prepared for this beautiful commitment (you peasant...)

## Libraries

Obviously we need to tackle some of the most common things that are required in almost every project like:

- GoogleAnalytics
- Lucky Orange
- Typy (this is heavily used to prevent errors and variables validation, I whole heartedly recommend it).
- Yup (The GOAT for nested validations)

## Backend Integration

Some things have been prepared to work better with a Django + Graphene backend, but it shouldn't be required.

## A word from the author

Welcome to my hell. It is 4am and the problems that beret me hath become bigger. Please dont mind the ramblings of this weeping mind. Sleep is fleeting. Life is pointless ... 42
